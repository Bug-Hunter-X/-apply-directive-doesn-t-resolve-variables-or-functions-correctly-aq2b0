This bug occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with custom styles that contain variables or functions.  The variables or functions might not resolve correctly, leading to unexpected styles or rendering errors. For example:

```css
:root {
  --custom-blue: #3498db;
}

.my-custom-class {
  @apply bg-blue-500; /* Works fine */
  @apply bg-var(--custom-blue); /* Might not work as expected */
}
```

The `bg-var(--custom-blue)` might not correctly apply the variable's value, instead leaving the element styled with its default state or generating an error depending on the browser and Tailwind configuration.
